   *"cpplot" ~ interactive figures you can show on the web*

This library allows you to create interactive graphs and charts in C++ 11 upward, which are
`viewable in-browser <https://cpplot.herokuapp.com>`_.

You can save figures to disc as ``\*.json`` files. Their contents are compliant with the
``plotly.js`` library schema so figures can be rendered in javascript.

Get going with the :ref:`quick start <quick_start>`, or :ref:`read about why I started this <why>`...
